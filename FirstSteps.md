I have a new collaborative,, final major project for University. We want to program an audio radar (E.A.R.D.A.R. Environmental Audio
Real-Time Detection And Ranging) for both Unity and Unreal engines to level the playing field for deaf and hard of hearing
gamers so they get a visual representation of the audio

landscape around them. In the picture is a rough idea of the sort of HUD elements we will be programming for. It should respond as sounds that
a hearing player would be able to hear (sound attenuators I am guessing) and adapt/adjust accordingly to loud sounds, for instance
 a flashbang goes off near them or a loud

explosion, other sounds would be less audible until the "in-game ear" equalises where the sounds would return to "normal" levels.
And from the picture a tank that would appear on the EARDAR would not have a symbol if it was close and being looked at
but would have a symbol if it went out of line-of-sight

That’s an incredible project — both technically ambitious and deeply meaningful for accessibility in games.
You’re essentially describing a real-time audio-to-visual sensory translation system, and your concept
(E.A.R.D.A.R.) is very well thought out already. Let’s break down how this could be approached in both Unreal
Engine and Unity, covering the architecture, audio data handling, and visualization.


🎯 High-Level Concept
Goal: Translate the 3D soundscape into a real-time HUD radar that visually represents the position, intensity, and type of sound sources in the player’s environment.

You want:

> A 360° radar (HUD or diegetic, like a wrist display or helmet overlay).

> Sound source icons (guns, footsteps, tanks, etc.).

> Dynamic range rings (distance-based: 50m, 100m, 200m).

> Audio attenuation simulation (muffling/exposure logic).

> Adaptive equalization (after explosions/flashbangs).

> Line-of-sight occlusion logic (hide icons for visible/nearby sources).

🧩 System Architecture Overview
Core Components
Audio Capture Layer

> Detects in-game sounds and their spatial data.

> Hooks into each sound source or uses an audio bus/analyzer.

> Sound Classifier

> Categorizes sound by type: footsteps, vehicles, explosions, etc.

> Maps them to visual icons and behavior profiles.

> Signal Processor

> Simulates human auditory phenomena (muffling, occlusion, tinnitus recovery).

> Controls how long and how strong sound icons persist on radar.

> Radar Visualizer (HUD/UI)

> Draws icons, circles, and intensity cues based on sound data.

> Updates in real-time (every frame or on audio events).

⚙️ Implementation Plan: Unreal Engine 5
1. Audio Capture
Use Audio Synesthesia and Audio Bus Monitoring:

Unreal’s Audio Modulation System + Submixes let you access real-time loudness, frequency, and spatialization.

Use UAudioSynesthesiaAnalyzer or USubmixListener to capture:
```
float Loudness;
FVector SourceLocation;
USoundClass* SoundType;
```
You can also attach an EARDAR component to AActors that produce sound:
```
UCLASS()
class UEARDARComponent : public UActorComponent
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
    float SoundIntensity;

    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
    USoundBase* SoundSource;
};
```
2. Sound Type Classification
Assign each sound asset a tag or SoundClass (e.g., “Footstep”, “Explosion”, “Vehicle”).
Store these in a DataTable to map:

SoundClass | Icon | Color | Lifetime | Range
3. Radar Visualization
Create a UMG Widget (EARDAR_Radar).

For each detected sound:

> Convert world position → player-relative polar coordinates.

> Adjust opacity/scale based on distance.

> Animate icon brightness based on intensity (RMS loudness).

> If a sound is out of line of sight → show the icon.

> If visible and close → fade it out.

4. Post-Explosion "Hearing Loss" Effect
Use a global float HearingSensitivity that decays when an explosion occurs and gradually returns to 1.0.
```
HearingSensitivity = FMath::Clamp(HearingSensitivity - Intensity * 0.5f, 0.1f, 1.0f);
```
All sound icons’ alpha or intensity would be multiplied by this value.

⚙️ Implementation Plan: Unity (C#)
1. Audio Source Data

```
Use OnAudioFilterRead()  or AudioSource.GetOutputData()
```
to monitor loudness per sound.

Each sound source registers itself with a central EARDARManager.

2. Sound Registry Example
```   
public class EARDARSound : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioSource audioSource;
    public string soundType;
    public float intensityMultiplier = 1.0f;
}
```
The manager gathers data from all active EARDARSound components and maps positions relative to the player.

4. HUD Visualization
Use a Canvas radar with a polar projection of sounds.
For example:
```
Vector3 dir = sound.transform.position - player.transform.position;
float angle = Mathf.Atan2(dir.x, dir.z) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
float distance = dir.magnitude;
```
Convert that into a radar position, then spawn or update icons accordingly.

🧠 Adaptive Audio Response
After a loud event (flashbang, explosion):

> Temporarily suppress quieter sounds (decrease their visual alpha).

> Add a fading visual distortion (ring expanding from center).

> Could simulate “temporary hearing damage” using a time-based envelope.

🧩 Technical Challenges
Challenge	Solution
Real-time sound detection	Use submix analysis (Unreal) or custom AudioSource tracking (Unity)
Line of sight	Raycast from player to sound source
Overlapping sounds	Prioritize by loudness & recency
Performance	Use pooling for sound icons
Accessibility tuning	Allow UI scale, contrast, colorblind modes, and dynamic thresholds
🎨 Future Enhancements
> Use machine learning to classify audio types automatically.

> Integrate with spatialized HRTF systems for more precise visual positioning.

> Allow users to record and replay their EARDAR experience for accessibility analysis.

If you’d like, I can:

Create a blueprint prototype plan (nodes and flow) for the UE5 version.

Or write a Unity C# EARDAR prototype script for your first test (with footstep and explosion icons).

Would you like me to start with the Unreal or Unity version first?

Apart from using machine learning could each sound have a 'tag' that would then be translated onto the HUD depending on whether a hearing player
would be able to hear it?

Thought for 8s
Absolutely—this is a great (and much simpler) way to ship v1.
You can make every sound-emitting thing carry a semantic tag + audibility metadata, then decide at runtime whether it should appear on the HUD based on a lightweight “audibility score” rather than ML.

Here’s a practical recipe that works in both Unreal and Unity.

1) Tag + metadata design
> Give each sound (or sound-emitting actor) a tag plus a small data record:

> Core fields

> Category (enum/tag): Footstep, Gunshot, Explosion, Vehicle, Voice, UI, Ambient, …

> BaseLoudness (0–1): proxy for SPL/“how loud this would be IRL”

> MaxEffectiveRange (m): beyond this, treat as inaudible

> OcclusionPenalty (0–1): how much walls/terrain reduce it

> MaskingClass: which other classes can mask it (e.g., Explosion masks Footsteps)

> Persistence (s): how long icon lingers after last audible frame

> Priority (int): tie-breaker for overcrowded HUD

> IconId / Style: which glyph to draw and any color/animation hints

> OnScreenSuppression: hide (or fade) if the source is on-screen & close

> Team/Faction (optional): for PvP filtering

> Stealthy (bool or multiplier): for suppressed weapons, sneaking, etc.

Represent this in:

Unreal: Gameplay Tags on the actor or USoundBase + a UDataTable (row struct with the fields above). You can also route by SoundClass.

Unity: a ScriptableObject “EardarSoundProfile” referenced by each AudioSource wrapper component.

2) The audibility score
Each frame (or on audio events), compute:

audibility =
    BaseLoudness
  * Attenuation(distance)         // inverse-square or your engine curve
  * OcclusionMultiplier           // raycast/collision based
  * EnvironmentMultipliers        // indoor/outdoor, weather, vehicle interior
  * HearingSensitivity            // drops after flashbang, recovers over time
  * SourcePlaybackRMS             // optional: live loudness meter
If audibility >= PerceptibilityThreshold (global or per-category), the sound qualifies for HUD.
Then apply masking: if a high-class event (Explosion) is present, temporarily down-weight classes it masks (Footsteps, Cloth).

Simple attenuation shapes
```
Attenuation(d) = clamp01(1 - d/MaxEffectiveRange) (cheap & stable)
```
Or sample the engine’s actual attenuation curve if you can

Occlusion
```
Do one physics line trace (player → source).
If blocked: OcclusionMultiplier = 1 - OcclusionPenalty.
```
Bonus: stack multiple hits or material-specific penalties.

3) HUD rules from the tags
Icon choice = IconId from profile.

> Angle = bearing relative to camera forward; radius = normalized distance.

> Opacity/scale = map from audibility (e.g., alpha = smoothstep(thresh, 1, audibility)).

> Linger = keep icon for Persistence seconds after dropping below threshold.

> On-screen suppression = if the actor is visible & within N meters, fade/hide (your “no symbol when you’re already looking at the tank” rule).

> Crowding = if >K icons, keep top Priority/audibility and cluster the rest.

4) Flashbang/explosion adaptation
Maintain a global HearingSensitivity (0.1–1.0):
```
On flashbang/explosion: HearingSensitivity -= k * eventIntensity (clamp to min)
```
> Recover with an exponential back to 1.0 over T seconds

> Optionally show a large expanding ring on the radar during recovery

> Quiet classes (Footstep/Cloth) get extra down-weight during recovery

5) Minimal engine patterns
Unreal (UE5)
Authoring

> Add Gameplay Tags to sound actors or USoundBase (Sound.Gunshot, Sound.Footstep…)

> Create a UDataTable mapping tag → profile fields above

> Runtime

Each sound actor has an UEardarEmitterComponent with:

> reference to profile (from tag → DataTable)

> optional hook to sample actual amplitude (submix meter) if desired

AEardarManager ticks:

> Gather active emitters in range

> Line trace for occlusion

> Compute audibility

> Apply masking & thresholds

> Push filtered list to a UMG UEardarRadarWidget

> In the widget, convert world → polar → screen; pool UImage icons

(If you already pipe SFX into submixes, add a USubmixMeter for per-class loudness; otherwise the static BaseLoudness works fine.)

Unity (C#)
Authoring

Create EardarSoundProfile : ScriptableObject (fields above)

> Component EardarEmitter : MonoBehaviour holding the profile + AudioSource

> Runtime

> EardarManager (singleton):

> Keeps a list of active EardarEmitters

For each: compute distance, optional Physics.Linecast, optional GetOutputData RMS

> Compute audibility, masking, persistence

> Update a Canvas-based radar (pooled Image/RectTransform)

> Hide/fade icons if EmitterIsVisibleToCamera && closeRange

6) Example profile table (excerpt)

| Tag / Category |	BaseLoudness	| MaxRange(m) |	OcclusionPenalty |	Persistence |	Priority |	Masks |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| Explosion |	1.00 |	220 |	0.15 |	1.0s |	100 |	Footstep, Cloth, VehicleIdle |
| Gunshot |	0.85 |	180 |	0.35 |	0.75s |	80 |	Footstep |
| VehicleEngine |	0.70 |	250 |	0.25 |	0.5s |	70 |	Footstep |
| Footstep |	0.30 |	35 |	0.60 |	0.35s |	20 |	— |
| VoiceShout |	0.55 |	90 |	0.40 |	0.6s |	40 |	Footstep |
Set PerceptibilityThreshold ≈ 0.2 (tune per game), then user options let players raise/lower it.

8) Accessibility & tuning knobs
Global scale for icon size/contrast; colorblind-safe palette

> Per-category on/off toggles (some players only want footsteps & gunshots)

> Threshold slider + distance ring spacing (e.g., 50/100/200 m)

> “Minimal mode”: show only top N strongest events

“Training mode”: briefly flash the real source outline to validate your heuristics

TL;DR
Yes—give every sound a tag + audibility metadata, compute a cheap audibility score each frame using distance, occlusion, environment,
 and a global hearing sensitivity (for flashbang effects). If the score clears the threshold, you render the tagged icon on the
 radar with rules like on-screen suppression and persistence. This is robust, explainable, performant, and fully cross-engine.

If you want, I can drop in a starter UE5 C++ component + UMG widget or a Unity C# manager + ScriptableObject scaffold with these fields wired up.
